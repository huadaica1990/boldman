h2#blogcontent1 Understanding How AI Can Improve WordPress SEO
p Using <a>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</a> in SEO is more than a passing trend. Many website owners have been experimenting with practical approaches to boost your WordPress site’s performance significantly. Here’s how:
h3#blogcontent1_1 Understanding Search Intent
p AI algorithms like those in Semrush can analyze high-level user needs from search queries. This analysis provides insights into what your audience is looking for, allowing you to tailor your content to meet their needs and expectations. You can vaguely tell if your content should fit into one of these buckets: Informational, Commercial, Transactional, or Navigational. <a>Search intent</a> helps you predict what searchers are looking for with a given term so you can provide the content they need. The more you address their needs, the more they may appreciate other insights you may provide in your content.
h3#blogcontent1_2 Enhancing Topical Authority
p You can create content demonstrating expertise and relevance in your niche by utilizing AI and Natural Language Processing (NPL) to develop rich content with related keywords and semantic topics. As search engines grow in sophistication, they’ll look for things beyond NPL and topical coverage, but these are good things to include at a base level. This approach helps search engines understand your content’s context. It also gives you something to add to your expertise while hitting the essential marks needed to rank.
h3#blogcontent1_3 Optimizing On-Page Elements
p AI can assist in fine-tuning meta descriptions and keyword usage. By analyzing SERP data, you can gain insights into competitor strategies, allowing you to improve your click-through rates and rankings.
h3#blogcontent1_4 Ensuring Quality with E-E-A-T Standards
p Part of the point of Google’s standard for rankable content is for site owners to lean into better content and not just more of it. Using a programmatic SEO approach with AI writers with little oversight isn’t the way to go. However, using AI correctly can make your writers even more efficient. AI can evaluate the quality and relevance of your content, ensuring alignment with the latest search engine guidelines. Factors such as expertise in the subject matter, the effort put into research, the authoritativeness of sources, the trustworthiness of information, content length, and readability are analyzed to meet high standards.

h2#blogcontent2 WordPress SEO Optimization with AI Tools
p We’ll spend most of our time in this article seeing how three <a>AI tools</a>, in particular, can help WordPress site owners with their SEO efforts. These are Semrush, Divi AI, and Rank Math SEO.
p First, let’s see how Semrush’s various tools can help set us up for success.
h3#blogcontent2_1 1. Outline and Keyword Research with Semrush
p <a>Semrush</a> is a comprehensive suite that aids SEO research, especially for WordPress sites. Its free Content Outline tool is a standout feature that helps you organize and optimize your keywords and ideas. Learn more about their <a>AI Content Outline Builder</a>.
h4#blogcontent2_1_1 How to Use the Semrush AI Outline Builder
p <a>Semrush’s Outline Builder</a> is the easiest-to-use AI tool by Semrush. You can use it and share up to three outlines for free. To get started, provide a topic you want to cover. We’re building a homepage for a boat tour business in Maine. We’ve tested this tool with blog articles, homepages, and landing pages—it performs well in each case. Click <strong>“Create Outline.”</strong>

    figcaption.cap How to Use the Semrush AI Outline Builder
p The first major aspect of the outline builder is the SEO Title. You have three options:
ol
    li Write your own title
    li Use AI suggestion (recommended)
    li See competitor titles that are ranking in the SERPs (excellent for research)
p In our case, we liked the AI’s first suggestion. When you’ve found yours, click “<strong>+ Use this title.</strong>”

    figcaption.cap
p Next, your options for article description mirror those for the title: write your own, draw inspiration from competitors, or adopt an AI suggestion. Feel free to start with an AI-suggested description and modify it to align with your vision.

    figcaption.cap
p Next, it will give you basic keyword recommendations, but using Semrush’s Keyword Overview tool is best, which we’ll touch on in a moment.
p The last major step is actually building your page outline. This section lists AI-suggested and competitor headings/questions based on your topic. Include the ones you want by dragging them over to your outline. You can even add your own using the “<strong>+ Add subheading/heading</strong>” button on the left. This table of contents section is excellent for structuring your page, whether it’s a landing page or a blog article.

p(style='text-indent: 50px') Finally, when satisfied, click “Preview” to see the finalized outline.
p <span class="drop-cap-plugin" style="font-weight:bold;float:left;display:inline-block;background-color:#27AE61;color:#fff;padding:5px 10px;border-radius:5px;margin:5px 10px" title="T">T</span>here are more options, but we’ve found that those are less helpful. If you want, you can explore AI-gathered “facts” that you can use in your articles and see what images competitors are using.
p.first-letter Semrush is better known as a robust research tool to help you find content gaps and trends, explore search volumes, and track SERP rankings.
p.first-cap Start your keyword research by entering the keyword you want to analyze into the search bar. Select the target region you want to focus on. Click “Search,” and Semrush will take you to the Keyword Overview page for that keyword.
